Starting now, have been recovering from corona and it's been a lot to do while being sick.

Worked on rk4 for 15 hours. There is something wrong and I'm unable to fix it

Changed algortihm to easy gravitational Vector based. Works well. Took me 5 hours. I have tested it with UI.

Now starting to work on GUI.

GUI working and looking amazing!! Worked with it around 10 hours.

Now starting to make it possible for user to add satellites. Got already the boxes to fill in, now just needs some work on functionality!!
Took me 5 hours to realise how the boxes work in swing.

Simulator is done !!!! :)
